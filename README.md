# weekend-hideout
A network infrastructure design project for learning

## What is this?
**Weekend-hideout** is a project for learning core network services (cache DNS servers, NTP servers, Firewalls, etc.).

We will build a network infrastructure using virtualization software running on a desktop PC.

There are no constraints in the selection of technologies for this project.

Let's create something interesting as per *my/your* own interest.

## Requirements
Please install the following prior to the setup procedure.
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox
- git

## Setup Procedure
The following procedure assumes you are operating on a Unix-like shell.
If you are using a Windows-based desktop PC, please use WSL or similar solution.


```
$ git clone https://github.com/m-t-a-n-a-k-a/weekend-hideout
$ cd weekend-hideout
$ vagrant up
```

## Future Prospects
TODO.md is a list of things that [Masaki Tanaka](https://github.com/m-t-a-n-a-k-a) would like to do in the future.
If you have any ideas, contributions are welcome.

## Note
This project is for learning purposes only. It does not guarantee compliance with best practices or production-ready robustness.
(I would be happy to refine this project to that level, of course.)
